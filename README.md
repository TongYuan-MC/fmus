## FMU Export Compatibility information

### Validation Tools

- [FMU check website](https://fmu-check.herokuapp.com/) (Mannual check for all: [win32/win64/linux64|cs/me|1.0/2.0/3.0])
- [Reference-FMUs](https://github.com/modelica/Reference-FMUs) (Auto check for all: [win32/win64/linux64|cs/me|1.0/2.0/3.0])

The reasons for not using other tools are as follows:
- [FMUComplianceChecker](https://github.com/modelica-tools/FMUComplianceChecker) only support FMI 1.0 and FMI2.0 and has been discontinued
- [FMPy](https://github.com/CATIA-Systems/FMPy) currently doesn't support FMI 3.0 for 32-bit, see [here](https://github.com/CATIA-Systems/FMPy/issues/394) for detail
- [FMI-VDM-Model](https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/FMI-VDM-Model) doesn't support FMI1.0


## Acknowledge

This project is used only for **cross-check purposes** by other tool vendors supporting FMI.
